**Summary Terms of Use for the SymMapp**

Do you tend to find Terms of Use long, difficult and full of legalese? So do we. Nevertheless, we think it is important to inform you about the way you can use the SymMapp.

For that reason, we have compiled this brief summary, which provides you with the necessary information and everything you need to know, presented in a nutshell!

**First and foremost, what is the SymMapp?**

-   SymMapp is part of a research project conducted by the University of Ghent and University of Hasselt. The app is part of a Citizen Science approach, where the reserach hope with the help of this App and with especially your help, in particular, to conduct research on the potential of collecting subjective health symptoms in order to map spread patterns that might be an indication of COVID-19. Users will keep a daily log where they register whether they believe to experience any symptoms or not. By collecting the data, the research project aims to predict outbreaks and spread patterns of COVID-19. This is done in a completely anonymized way, respecting the complete privacy of the user (more information under 7. 'Confidentiality and theoretical anonymity').

**When can you use the App?**

-   Before you can start using the App, you must accept our Terms of Use, which explain the rules for using our services.
-   To use the App, you must be of legal age (18 years or older).
-   There is no charge for using the App.


**How can you use the App?**

-   You may only use the App for the purpose it was originally intended and together with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your own use.

**Terms of Use for the SymMapp**

**1\. General**

These Terms of Use (hereinafter "Terms of Use") describe the conditions under which the SymMapp application (hereinafter "the App") can be used. 

This App has been developed by the University of Ghent, public institution with legal personality, with registered office at 9000 Ghent, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 25 and company number 0248.015.142 (hereinafter referred to as "UGent") in collaboration with "In the Pocket ITP Agency NV" with registered office at Sassevaartstraat 46/401, 9000 Ghent, with company number 0825.170.684, (hereinafter referred to as "In The Pocket").

**2\. Definitions**

**App:** The SymMapp mobile and online application to which these Terms of Use apply

**User:** The person who registers through the App and intends to use the App.

**Location Data**: GPS - This data will be used by the app to determine your location against a map of the area of Greater Ghent (the City of Ghent and its fourteen surrounding counties). This map is divided into different cells and their size depends on the population density, meaning a cell will be larger in less populated areas in order to meet the minimum number of inhabitants required to ensure anonymity. The app will not store nor share the GPS data, rather the cell-IDs of the cells that match your location. 

**Health Data**: This includes information about the User's subjective health status your subjective health data contain information about your state of health as you describe it when filling in your symptoms in the App. 

**User Data**: These are Data about the actions you perform as a User with the App, such as opening and closing the App. The App registers how often and at what times you perform these actions.

**Functional Data**: These include the type of device, the language setting of your device's operating system (e.g. Be-NL or Be-Fr), the store in which you downloaded and installed the App, together with its version name (Android) and bundle (iOS), the time (in milliseconds) when you first opened the App and the duration of use of the App, rounded up to the next hour, as well as the country where the User is staying.

**Cookies:** Functional and behavioural cookies are used to determine whether you are experiencing problems using the App, possibly due to a bug. These behavioural cookies are only used to support the User in using the App in case there is a bug in the App. We will only use the behavioural cookies if you have given your explicit permission to do so in the cookie banner.

**Data:** All Data accessible through the App, including Location Data, Subjective Health Data, User Data and Functional Data.

**Equipment:** The (peripheral) equipment, including a smartphone or tablet with which the User uses the App, including the associated operating system.

**Controller**: Ghent University (hereinafter UGent).

**Processor**: In The Pocket for all Data processed by the App and Google Cloud for the storage and retention of this Data.

**Theoretical anonymity**: The concept of theoretical anonymity means that even if someone would be in possession of all available information related to the use of this app, it is theoretically impossible to identify any individual user of the application. Based on the information that the app collects and that is stored in a Cloud server, it’s not possible for anyone who has access to this information (i.e. the researchers or app developers) to determine which subjective health data or cellID-logs on the map belong to a specific user.

**3\. Applicability and changes**

These Terms of Use apply to the use of the App.

After downloading the App, you as a User will be asked to agree to these Terms of Use.

**5\. Use of the App** 

The purpose of this App is to generate accurate and up-to-date data for evidence-based policy choices in times of crisis and potentially to alleviate healthcare. By collecting the information, we will have a better understanding how COVID-19 spreads, as well as the possibility of using mobile application to monitor the expansion rate of the pandemic in urban and non-urban areas. 

Under no circumstances will your Data be used or linked to other data for individual monitoring or enforcement purposes.

You download the App. Once you have downloaded the App, you will be asked to agree to these Terms of Use. We encourage you to read this information carefully. Downloading and agreeing to the Terms of Use implies your consent to the operation of the App. This means that from that moment on, User Data and Functional Data about you will be collected and processed.

Subsequently, the App will ask for your separate consent to the collection and processing of Location Data, and your Subjective Health Data. You always have the option to withdraw your individual consent(s).

Use of the App is strictly personal and at your own expense and risk only. The App is intended for private and individual use only. The App may not be used for commercial or business purposes. The App is intended for Users in the area of Greater Ghent only (see 2. Definitions). Although access from outside this area is possible, the App is not intended for such use and these Users also access the App at their own risk. Furthermore, all information logged outside the area of Greater Ghent will not be registered by the App or collected for analysis.

You are solely responsible for the correct and careful use of the App and you must refrain from any unauthorised and careless use of it. In particular, this means:

(a)   that you enter the Data truthfully;

(b) that you do not use the App for acts and/or conduct that is contrary to applicable laws or regulations, good morals, public order, or the rights of third parties. Under no circumstances is it permitted to add Data, documents or files to the App that have illegal or offensive content or (otherwise) infringe the privacy of third parties.

(c) that you do not use the App in such a way that its (correct) functioning is prevented, security is breached or damage is caused to UGent, In The Pocket, the App or third parties.

You indemnify UGent and In The Pocket against all possible claims by third parties as a result of acting in violation of these Terms of Use.

It is up to you to look after the necessary hardware and software, peripherals and (internet) connections at your own expense to enable access to, and use of, the App and the User Account. As a User, you cannot claim any compensation for the use of the Data by UGent.

You will provide UGent and In The Pocket with all cooperation that can reasonably be expected of you in performing maintenance work on the App.

The use of the App may be terminated by you at any time by uninstalling it (See: "Termination and deactivation of the App").

**6\. Registration and age**

To use the App, you need to go through an onboarding flow. In this flow, you must truthfully enter the information requested by UGent. Any changes to Data should be made immediately via the App.

By accepting the Terms of Use, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. Users under 18 are not permitted to use the App.

**7\. Confidentiality and theoretical anonymity**

The primary research goal of this project is to test what could be the added value of designing apps to collect potentially insightful information on spread-patterns by using subjective health data (given that all information are self-assessments of the users health conditions).

The app itself however is a finished product that has been tested throughout the development process in order to 1) Optimize the user-friendliness of the onboarding flow based on user-feedback and 2) developing the methodology and onboarding flow around the concept of theoretical anonymity.

As stated before, The concept of theoretical anonymity means that even if someone would be in possession of all available information related to the use of this app, it is theoretically impossible to identify any individual user of the application. Based on the aggregated information that the app collects and that is stored in a Cloud server, it’s not possible for anyone who has access to this information (i.e. the researchers or app developers) to determine which subjective health data or cellID-logs on the map belong to a specific user. The fact that all data in the Cloud is aggregated, means it is only possible to determine the total incidences of a given subjective symptom (i.e. “loss of taste) per cell for a given time interval.

The onboarding flow works in such a way, that all information is being pre-processed by the app and send to the Cloud server in a specific fashion to safeguard the theoretical anonymity approach:

- 	All cellIDs and subjective health data are completely detached from each other and stored in the Cloud server as part of a specific cell on the grid not linked to a user.

-   The app will push only 50 percent of the collected subjective health data. The interval, at which data is being pushed to the Cloud, as well as the determination process of which data to push, is being done at random, making it impossible to reverse engineer the process.

This approach allows the app to collect information on spread-patterns and transmission rates of subjective health data, without using personal location data or jeopardizing the privacy of the users. 

**8\. Costs**

UGent does not charge for the use of the App. The User bears the costs of the purchase and use of the Equipment and connections (mobile and/or wireless internet) required for the use of the services via the App.

**9\. Liability**
